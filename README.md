### Word Count Problem
The solution takes the text files in the directory wc_input and sorts them alphabetically by their names into a list called FILES. Furthermore it iterates over lines of all the text files and counts the frequency of each word. In order to find the words, first I remove the following characters from each line
`<"'-_.">`
ine the At the end, the words are sorted  alphabetically and printed along with their counts separated. The results is into a text file called
wc_result. This is in wc_output directory.
