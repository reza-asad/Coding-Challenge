Do I need to account for digits (e.g 0-9)?
No, for simplicity you may assume that the text files do not contain any digits.

Do I need to account for complicated Unicode characters?
No, you may assume that all of the characters are conventional, ASCII characters.

Should I check if the files in the input directory are text files or non text files(binary)? No, for simplicity you may assume that all of the files in the input directory are standard text files.

Will our program need to look for text files in any subdirectories of the wc_input directory?
No, for simplicity you may assume that the wc_input directory only contains text files, with no subdirectories.

What if I need to load a library or dependency for my program to run?
Make sure that your run.sh script loads all the dependencies for your program. These dependencies should also be well documented in your Markdown README.

Do I need separate programs for WordCount and Running Median?
No, you may use a single combined program or several programs, as long as they are all executed by the run.sh script.

Does the run.sh script need to be a Bash script (i.e. on Linux or Mac OSX)?
Yes - Unix based systems like Linux and MacOSX are the standard in the field of Data Engineering - and the system needs to be compiled and tested on a Unix based system. With that said, you can use emulators like Cygwin if you only have access to a Windows system.

Can I use an IDE like Eclipse to write my program?
Yes, you can use what ever tools you want - as long as your run.sh script correctly runs the relevant target files and creates the wc_result.txt and med_result.txt files in the wc_output directory.

What should be in the wc_input directory?
You can put any text file you want in the directory. In fact, this could be quite helpful for testing your solutions.
