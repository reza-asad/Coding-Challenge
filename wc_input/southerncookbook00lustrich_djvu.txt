Introduction 



pEOPLE think of the Southland as the place where the sun shines brighter, the breezes are 
* gentler, the birds sing sweeter and the flowers are fairer. We, who have edited this cook 
book, which we hope you will find helpful, think of the Southland as the hearthstone of superb 
cooking. To attempt a Southern Cook Book in one small pamphlet was an ambitious under- 
taking. There were many fine recipes that should have been included but lack of space would 
not permit. It became the editors' problem to select as many, as varied and as useful a collection 
of recipes as it was possible to include in these few pages. Many fine dishes had to be omitted 
to make way for better ones. 

The natural, geographic and climatic advantages of the different sections of the sunny South 
have played an important part in Dixie cookery. The fertile fields, plentiful fruit trees and 
waterways have each contributed bountifully. Every part of the Southland is individual and 
distinctive in its cookery. The "Creole Dish" of New Orleans has nothing to do with racial 
origin but rather indicates the use of red and green peppers, onions and garlic. Oranges, grape- 
fruit and avocados play an important part in Florida cookery. Maryland is famous for its fried 
chicken and its delicious sea food recipes. One thinks of Virginia, its hot breads and its sugar- 
cured hams. Kentucky is known for its corn "likker" and its flannel cakes. Only one thing is 
universally true: Every corner of the South is famous for its fine cookery. 

As you glance through this book you will find many delicious dishes . . . many excellent 
combinations. You will find here the carefully-guarded secrets of real Southern cooking, 
palatable and tempting to the eye. You will find accurate, tried and tested recipes . . . each 
one a gastronomical delight. 

The very name "Southern Cookery" seems to conjure up the vision of the old mammy, head 
tied with a red bandanna, a jovial, stoutish, wholesome personage ... a wizard in the art of 
creating savory, appetizing dishes from plain everyday ingredients. But it should be remem- 
bered that not all the good cooks of the Southland were colored mammies ... or folks who 
lived on plantations. Southern city folks are also famous for their hospitality, their flare for 
entertaining and the magnificence of their palate-tickling culinary efforts. Most of the recipes 
in this book were gathered from this latter source, though they undoubtedly in many cases owe 
their origin to the colored mammies who rarely bothered to write down their recipes . . . for 
they were good cooks who most often could neither read nor write . . . didn't have to ... you 
just put 'em in front of a stove with the fixin's and they created somethin' grand . . . even if 
they couldn't always 'splain you jus' how. 

All your life you have heard of the traditionally famous dishes of the South- 
land. No names appear so frequently on hotel menus as Dixie names. No cook- 
ing seems more famous or synonymous with quality and deliciousness than 
Southern cooking. You will find here, published for the first time in book form, 
we believe, the truly amazing recipe for "Kentucky Burgoo", and the 

celebrated recipe for "Pot Likker", which is a familiar dish in almost ,-v 

every part of the South, particularly in the homes of the poor white 

and the negro. We believe this book to contain a remarkable cross- iST 

section of fine recipes 
and we hope you will 
find it a valuable aid in 
your culinary efforts.

THE SOUTHERN COOK BOOK 



KENTUCKY BURGOO 

(This recipe makes 1200 gallons) 

"Kentucky Burgoo" is the celebrated stew which is served in Kentucky on Derby Day, at 
Political Rallies, Horse Sales and at other outdoor events. This recipe is from a hand- 
written copy by Mr. J. T. Looney, of Lexington. Mr. Looney is Kentucky's most f amou ^ 
Burgoo-maker and it was for him that Mr. E. R. Bradley named his Kentucky Derby winner 
"Burgoo King". Mr. Looney uses a sauce of his own in the preparation of this truly-amazing 
concoction. 

Mr. Looney is invited to all parts of the country to prepare Burgoo for large gatherings. 
This is not a dish to be attempted by an amateur though it can be prepared in smaller quan- 
tities. It is a very picturesque sight to* see Mr. Looney, aided by many negro assistants, pre- 
paring this dish over open fires and huge kettles which are kept simmering all night. 
600 pounds lean soup meat (no fat, no bones) 
200 pounds fat hens 
2000 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced 
200 pounds onions 

5 bushels of cabbage, chopped 
60 ten-pound cans of tomatoes 
24 ten-pound cans puree of tomatoes 
24 ten-pound cans of carrots 
18 ten-pound cans of corn 

Red pepper and salt to taste 

Season with Worcestershire, Tabasco, or A#l Sauce 

Mix the ingredients, a little at a time, and cook outdoors in huge iron kettles over 
wood fires from 15 to 20 hours. Use squirrels in season . . . one dozen squirrels to each 
100 gallons. (See Recipe Page 13.) 

"Burgoo is literally a soup composed of many vegetables and meats delectably fused 
together in an enormous caldron, over which, at the exact moment, a rabbit's foot at the end of 
a yarn string is properly waved by a colored preacher, whose salary has been paid to date. 
These are the good omens by which the burgoo is fortified." 

"Carey's Dictionary of Double Derivations" 

POT LIKKER 

(Made famous by the late Senator Huey P. Long) 

Into 3 quarts of cold water, put a %-pound piece of salt pork and place on fire to boil 
for 45 minutes. Wash young turnip greens in several waters and clean them well. Put them 
into the pot along with the pork and let boil for another hour. Drain the water from the 
greens and meat; chop the greens rather fine and season well with salt and pepper. Place 
the greens on a hot dish and on top arrange slices of the pork; pour over the greens and meal 
about iMj cups of the water in which the greens were cooked (pot likker). Cornmeal dodgers 
are frequently served along with this dish and are arranged around the greens. 

CORN MEAL DODGER FOR POT LIKKER 

Vz pint white corn meal 

Vz teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons melted butter or other shortening 
cold water 

Add salt to corn meal and stir in the melted butter. 
Add sufficient cold water so dough will hold shape. 
Mould dough into biscuit size pieces and drop into boil- 
ing pot likker. Cook in closely covered pot for twenty 
minutes. Serve garnished with the greens from the 
"pot likker". 

Kentucky, oh Kentucky, 

How I love your classic shades, 

Where flit the fairy figures 
Of the star-eyed Southern maids; 

Where the butterflies are joying 
'Mid the blossoms newly born; 

Where the corn is full of kernels, 
And The Colonels Full of Corn!

Burgoo For Small Parries 

Meat from any domestic beasts or barnyard 
fowls may be used, along with any garden 
vegetables desired. Originally, the burgoo 
was made from wild things found in the 
woods of Kentucky. 

Cut meat to be used into inch cubes; do not 
throw away bones; add them to meat cubes. 
Add any dried vegetables which will enhance 
flavor of stew. Put all materials into large 
stewing kettle, unless beans and potatoes are 
being used. If this is the case, cook meats 
first, and add beans and potatoes about an 
hour before serving. 

FiU kettle half full of water and place over 
fire to come to a boil. Prepare other vegeta- 
bles for stew. Peel and halve onions, scrape 
end dice carrots, pare and cube potatoes. 
When liquid in kettle is boiling, add vegeta- 
bles. Lower heat and continue to simmer stew 
until vegetables are tender. Add salt and sea- 
sonings when stew is almost cooked. There 
should always be enough water to cover the 
vegetables. Canned tomatoes will add to the 
flavor of the broth. In a real burgoo, no thick- 
ening like meal or rice is used, because the 
broth is to be strained and served clear. Like- 
wise sweet vegetables we r e not used in the 
real burgoos. (See Page 6.)

Opossum 

The opossum is a very fat animal, with a 
peculiarly flavored meat. It is dressed much 
as one would dress a suckling pig (for pro- 
cedure, see recipe below), removing the en- 
trails, and if desired, the head and tail. After 
it has been dressed, wash thoroughly inside and 
outside with hot water. Cover with cold water 
to which has been added 1 cup of salt. Allow 
to stand overnight; in the morning, drain off 
the salted water and rinse well with clear, boil- 
ing water. 

Make a stuffing as follows: Melt 1 tablespoon 
of butter in a frying pan and add 1 large onion 
which has been chopped fine. When the onion 
begins to brown, add the finely chopped liver of 
the opossum,^ if desired, and cook until the 
liver is tende'r and well done. Add 1 cup of 
bread crumbs, a little chopped red pepper, a 
dash of Worcestershire sauce, 1 finely chopped 
hard cooked egg, salt and water to moisten. 
Stuff the opossum with the mixture, fastening 
the opening securely with skewers or by sewing. 
Put in a roasting pan, add 2 tablespoons of 
water and roast in a moderate oven (350 F.) 
until the meat is very tender and richly 
browned. Baste constantly with the opossum's 
own fat. When sufficiently roasted, take from 
the oven, remove the skewers or stitches, and 
put the opossum on a heated platter. Skim the 
grease from the gravy remaining in the pan; 
serve the gravy in a sauceboat. Serve with baked 
yams or sweet potatoes. 

Roast Suckling Pig 

For roast suckling pig use only the very 
young pigs not over six weeks old. Scald 
them by immersing in very hot water (not 
boiling) for 1 minute. Remove from the 
water and use a very dull knife to scrape off 
hair in order that skin will not be broken. 
Then cut a slit from the bottom of the throat 
to the hind legs and remove the entrails and 
organs, being careful not to break the brains. 
Wash thoroughly in cold water and chill. Fill 
with any desired poultry stuffing and sew 
opening. Roast in a moderate oven (350 F.) 
from 3 to 4 hours. When serving place a red 
apple in mouth of pig and serve with candied 
sweet potatoes and apple sauce.

Tallahassee Hush Puppies 

Embodied in the title of this recipe is a most 
interesting story. 

Years ago (in some sections it is still the 
custom) the negroes of Tallahassee, Florida, 
that quaint southern capital, would congregate 
on warm fall evenings for cane grindings. Some 
of them would feed the sugar cane to a one- 
mule treadmill while others poured the juice 
into a large kettle where it was boiled to sugar. 
After their work was completed, they would 
gather around an open fire, over which was 
suspended an iron pot in which fish and corn 
pones were cooked in fat. 

The negroes were said to have a certain way 
of making these corn pones which were un- 
usually delicious and appetizing. While the 
food was sizzling in the pot, the darkies would 
engage in rather weird conversations, spell- 
binding each other with "tall" stories of panther 
and bear hunts. On the outer edge of the circle 
of light reflected by the fire would sit their 
hounds, their ears pricked for strange sounds 
and their noses raised to catch a whiff of the 
savory odor of the frying fish and pones. If the 
talking ceased for a moment, a low whine of 
hunger from the dogs would attract the atten- 
tion of the men, and subconsciously a hand 
would reach for some of the corn pone which 
had been placed on a slab of bark to cool. The 
donor would break off a piece of the pone and 
toss it to a hungry dog, with the abstract 
murmur, "Hush, puppy!" 

The effect of this gesture on the hounds was 
always instantaneous and the negroes attrib- 
uted the result to the remarkable flavor of 
what eventually became known as "The 
Tallahassee Hush Puppy." 

2 cups corn meal 
2 teaspoons baking powder

a soft but workable dough. With the hands, 
mold pieces of the 
dough into pones (ob- 
long cakes, about 5 
inches long and 3 
inches wide, and about 
''4 of an inch thick). 
Fry in deep hot fat or 
oil until well browned.

Mint Julep 

Few folks agree as to what should constitute 
a really good mint julep. The controversy 
dates back to Captain Marryat who contended 
that he had learned how to make the real 
julep with fair success. Following his instruc- 
tions, we do not crush the sprigs of tender 
mint shoots, we use a little sugar and equal 
portions of peach and common brandy, and 
we fill our glass with shaved ice. "Stalactites" 
of ice will form on the tumbler; and as the 
ice melts, we drink. 

A Georgia writer of fifty years ago summed 
up the matter thus: "The mint julep still lives, 
but is by no means fashionable. Somehow the 
idea has gotten abroad that the mint ought to 
be crushed and shaken up with water and 
whisky in equal proportions. No man can fall 
in love with such a mixture." 

Then there is the Kentucky colonel who 
advises crushing the mint within the glass 
until no place has been left untouched. We 
are then to throw away the mint; in so doing, 
"it is a sacrifice." This is "the one way of 
perfection" in concocting this "most delectable 
libation of man." 

For each glass of mint julep, dissolve two 
lumps of sugar in enough water to form a sort 
of oily syrup. In a glass crush a few sprigs of 
tender mint shoots until most of the mint es- 
sence has been extracted. Remove the mint 
from the glass; fill the glass with cracked ice, 
and pour in the quantity of Bourbon desired. 
Allow the Bourbon to become thoroughly 
chilled and then add the heavy sugar syrup. 
Let the glass stand for a few moments, not 
stirring it at all. Place sprigs of fresh mint 
around the rim of the glass ; serve immediately.

then fill glass with shaved ice and mix thor- 
oughly with a spoon. The glass should be 
frosted when the drink is served.
